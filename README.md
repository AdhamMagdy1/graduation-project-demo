## About


ChefBot is a comprehensive food ordering platform that connects customers with various restaurants, providing a seamless and interactive ordering experience. The system is built with a real-time communication architecture using Socket.io and leverages NLP with the Rasa framework to interact with customers in Egyptian Arabic dialect. The platform is divided into two main parts: the restaurant side and the customer side.


## Key Features

  <h4>Customer Side</h4>

- Customers can interact with an AI chatbot in real-time to order foods in our mobile-responsive web app by opening restaurant link that is auto generated by our system and should be presented on their social media.
- The chatbot utilizes NLP with Rasa to understand customer preferences and provide recommendations based on the restaurant's offerings by accessing restaurant foods stored in databse.
- The chatbot communicates in Egyptian Arabic dialect, making it more accessible and user-friendly for local customers.
- Once a customer confirms an order with the AI bot, the system sends the order details to the respective restaurant order dashboard
